# About

This repo is a scratchpad for the files and lessons learned from [Intro To Node](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/course-overview/) on Front End Masters.

I learn by writing and blowing things up. All of my repositories that start with the word "learnings" are from tutorials or books I have read.

-   documenting things I learned so I can use them as resource later
-   Introduction to mocha testing
-   general awesomeness in Node development
